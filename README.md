Sums and ratios of random variables. Minimum and maximum of several random variables (first bit of 3.7.)

(Note: 3.6.2 will not be covered as it involves the full machinery of multi-variable calculus. Anyone who continues with probability will definitely revisit these methods.)

Expected value, variance, standard deviation (time permitting.)
